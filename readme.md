#Task 8: Reflection

> What did you learn? What did you kow already?

This lab has mostly helped me sharpen my skills 
with pointers, which is an important subject.

> What was difficult in the lab? How did you overcome it?

The most difficult part was probably to figure out how to implement all the
previous functions using pointers, but some googleing, YouTube and trial and
error made it work.

> How can the lab be improved?

The lab was good I think. I don't have anything more to add.

> Additionally, write an estimate how many hours you spent on this lab.

Probably around 30 hours. So way faster than Lab2 at least.
